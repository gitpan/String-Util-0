VERSION
    Version 0.10 December 1, 2005
        Initial release

    Version 0.11 December 22, 2005
        This is a non-backwards compatible version.

        urldecode, urlencode were removed entirely. All of the subs that
        used used to modify values in place were changed so that they do not
        do so anymore, except for fullchomp.

        See

        ml for why these changes were made.
